# 1951CoffeeCollective
Created by Anika Hauser, Cheryl Tugade, and Zarmina Yousafzai during 2024 Hack For Impact! 

Introduce the Coffee Collective, a user-managed coffee subscription service for 1951 Coffee Company located in Berkeley, CA. Through the click of a button, a customer can onboard themselves to the Collective, and receive their choice of coffee on a schedule that works for them!

Utilizing Node.js, Express.j, and a SQLite Database, 1951 can now manage and view all their subscribers in one place. Users can simply log into their account, and edit their Collective settings instantly.
